\par{
    Solution Architect with interest on video streaming (OTT/IPTV ), cloud architectures and virtualized frameworks such as AWS and Kubernetes.

    Throughout my career I've developed strong analytics skills to compare cutting edge technologies, to lead proof of concepts by developing prototypes and specs for new architectures. 
    Additionally, I'm an active collaborator to open source projects so I've developed solid backgrounds on programming languages such as C/C++, Python and Javascript.
