\par{
Telecommunications Engineer with about ten years of experience on media broadcast technologies and data network engineering. I'm a highly motivated person to learn and explore. My main interests are related with new data communications protocols (TCP/IP) and services oriented to Video and Media.

Currently, I work as Media Solution Architect with focus on video technologies such as IPTV and OTT services so I've developed a strong knowledge on encoding, video delivery and video quality assessment techniques. As Solution Architect, I also have strong understanding of cutting-edge infrastructure tools such as virtualization, cloud computing and containerization (Docker and Kubernets).

I've also collaborated in academic research with interest in QoS Measurements over data networks. In this way I have strong programming skills on typical development tools such as C/C++, Python, Data Bases and R.
