\par{
Telecommunications Engineer with about ten years of experience on media broadcast technologies and data network engineering. I'm a highly motivated person to learn and explore. My main interests are related with new data communications protocols (TCP/IP) and services oriented to Video and Media.

Currently, I work as Tech Architect with focus on media and video technologies such as IPTV and OTT services so I've developed a strong knowledge on encoding, video delivery and video quality assessment techniques. As Tech Architect, I also have a deep understanding of cutting-edge infrastructure tools such as virtualization, cloud infrastructure (AWS) and containerization (Docker and Kubernets).

I've also collaborated in academic research with interest in QoS Measurements over data networks. In this way I have strong programming skills on typical development tools such as C/C++, Python, Data Bases and R.
