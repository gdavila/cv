    Electronic Engineer with  experience on solution architecture, broadcast technologies and video services. I'm a highly motivated person to learn and explore new technologies. In particular, I'm interested on cloud based architectures and video streamming  technologies.

    Currently, I work as Tech Architect with focus on  video services  over  virtualized frameworks and cloud infrastructures.  In this way, I have a deep understanding of either the end to end video delivery chain and new services architectures such as cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes and Docker.
    
    Additionally, I have experience driving proof of concepts to validate new technologies, collaborating to open source projects and doing academic research so I have strong background on classical programming languajes such as C/C++, Python, Javascript, Data Bases and R.
